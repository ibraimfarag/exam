-   [Multiple modals 'Paste as HTML' after longer pressing ctrl+v #849](https://github.com/xdan/jodit/issues/849)

## (2022-01-06) @xdan

#### :rocket: New Feature

Added `memorizeChoiceWhenPasteFragment` option: When the user inserts a piece of HTML, the plugin will ask - How to insert it.
If after that user insert the same fragment again, the previous option will be used without extra question.
